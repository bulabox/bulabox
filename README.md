3D Lab Project,
Jan 2014
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The project:

  This project was realized during my studies in Electronics Engineering at the Faculty of Sciences (FDS), State University of Haiti (UEH).
   The goal was to create a 3D software allowing a user to visualize a building in 3D. The user uses a robot to navigate in the scene. For this same building, the software presents the cutting planes and the basic plans. I had thought  it could be useful to companies or a civil engineer by giving the client this software to visualize all the aspects  of the building to be built.
